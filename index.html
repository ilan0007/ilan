    Boeing F-15SE Silent Eagle Mitsubishi F-15J The McDonnell Douglas F-15 Eagle is an American twin-engine, all-weather
    tactical fighter aircraft designed by McDonnell Douglas (now Boeing) to gain and maintain air supremacy in all aspects
    of aerial combat. Following reviews of proposals, the United States Air Force selected McDonnell Douglas' design in 1967
    to meet the service's need for a dedicated air superiority fighter. The Eagle first flew in July 1972, and entered service
    in 1976. It is among the most successful modern fighters, with over 100 victories and no losses in aerial combat, with
    the majority of the kills by the Israeli Air Force.[3][4]</p>
